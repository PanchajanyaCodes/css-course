CSS Display:
block, inline and inline-block.

1. margin, height and width cannot be applied to inline elements.

2. block level elements have a 100% width and leaves a line after, by default.

3. inline-block => It combines the characteristics of both inline and block elements.

4. display => This property can be used to set block, inline or inline-block.

5. margin-inline => only sets margin to left and right.

6. display:none; => completely hides an element from the page. The element and its content are not displayed, and it does not occupy any space in the layout.
