1. position => property determines the positioning of an element within its container. Possible values are (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky).

2. "static" is the default value for the position property in CSS. It means the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

3. "relative" allows you to adjust the position of an element relative to its original position in the document flow. It means the element maintains its original space in the layout, but you can offset it using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

4. "absolute" removes an element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (the viewport).

5. "fixed" positions an element relative to the viewport (the browser window). This means the element stays in the same position even when the page is scrolled.

6. "sticky" combines the characteristics of "relative" and "fixed". It allows an element to behave like a relatively positioned element until it reaches a specified offset, at which point it behaves like a fixed element.

7. z-index => It determines which element appears on top when elements overlap.

8. scroll-behavior:smooth; => makes the scrolling smoother.
